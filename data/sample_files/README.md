# Sample Files Directory

This directory contains sample files for testing the IPFS Ring DHT Simulator.

## Files:

1. **test1.txt** - Simple text file (~200 bytes)
2. **test2.txt** - Medium text file (~400 bytes)  
3. **test3.txt** - Configuration-style file

## Usage:

When running the simulator, you can use these file paths:
- `data/sample_files/test1.txt`
- `data/sample_files/test2.txt`
- `data/sample_files/test3.txt`

The simulator will hash these paths to generate file keys within your configured identifier space.
